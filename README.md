Testing with skinned animation

[#BuiltWithMonoGame](http://www.monogame.net), [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com) models.

For now xbot and ybot animation are working (colors are wrong), because [SkinnedEffect.fx](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/master/MonoGame.Framework/Platform/Graphics/Effect/Resources/SkinnedEffect.fx) doesnt use the diffuse color.
Models with texture you nedd to fix de texture path after you download them and put the texture file next to the fbx (you can get the texture downloading the dae format).

Textured models works fine, you need to fix the texture path after downloading (download the ascii version) and put the texture file next to the fbx (you can get the texture by downloading the dae format).
